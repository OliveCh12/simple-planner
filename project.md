# Product Specifications: Timeline Roadmap Application

## Product Overview

This is a visual roadmap application that helps users plan and track life goals, projects, and objectives across time. The application presents a horizontal timeline organized by months, where users can create, manage, and monitor their objectives with an elegant, minimalist interface that emphasizes clarity and progress tracking.

## Core Concept & User Experience

The application displays time as a horizontal scrollable timeline, with each month represented as a distinct card or block. Users can navigate across months and years to plan far into the future or review past accomplishments. The interface automatically highlights the current timeframe, helping users understand where they are in their journey at a glance.

The design philosophy centers on simplicity and visual clarity. Past months appear muted or grayed out, while future months remain vibrant and accessible. The current month receives special visual treatment to draw the user's attention to their immediate priorities.

## Objective Structure & Data Model

Each objective within a month contains several properties that help users understand the scope and nature of their goals. The title serves as a quick identifier, while the description provides context and details about what needs to be accomplished. The energy property indicates how demanding or significant an objective is, helping users balance their commitments realistically.

Duration tracking allows users to specify how many days within the month an objective will require. For objectives that span the entire month, the application pins them to the top of the month block, distinguishing ongoing commitments from shorter-term tasks. This creates a natural visual hierarchy where month-long objectives act as themes or major focuses, while shorter objectives appear below in chronological order.

The chronological ordering within each month is crucial to the user experience. If today is October 14th, the objective scheduled for that timeframe should be highlighted, giving users immediate context about what they should focus on right now. This transforms the roadmap from a static planning tool into a dynamic guide that evolves with time.

## Enhanced Data Schema

I recommend expanding the data model to include additional properties that will make the application more powerful while maintaining simplicity. Here's the proposed schema:

**Roadmap**: The top-level container that represents a complete timeline (like "Career Goals 2024-2026" or "Personal Life Roadmap"). Each roadmap has a unique identifier, title, description, start year, and end year. This allows users to create multiple roadmaps for different areas of life without mixing contexts.

**Month Block**: Represents a calendar month within a roadmap. It contains the year, month number, and a collection of objectives. The month block can also store a color theme or visual style preference, allowing users to visually differentiate between different periods.

**Objective**: The core unit of planning. Beyond title, description, energy level, and duration, I suggest adding several fields. A status property tracks whether the objective is pending, in progress, completed, or cancelled. Start and end dates within the month provide precise scheduling. A priority level helps with ordering when multiple objectives compete for attention. Tags or categories enable filtering and organization across the roadmap. An optional completion date records when objectives are actually finished, creating historical data for reflection.

For objectives that need breaking down, consider allowing subtasks or checkpoints. This gives users flexibility to track progress on complex objectives without cluttering the main timeline view.

## Data Persistence Strategy for 2025

Since you want a frontend-only application with persistent data, the most effective modern approach combines browser storage with optional cloud synchronization. Here's a sophisticated strategy that balances simplicity with reliability:

**Primary Storage: IndexedDB**: Use IndexedDB as your main client-side database. Unlike localStorage, IndexedDB can handle large amounts of structured data efficiently and supports complex queries. Libraries like Dexie.js make working with IndexedDB straightforward and provide a clean API similar to modern databases. IndexedDB is reliable, fast, and works offline by default.

**Backup Strategy: Export/Import**: Provide users with the ability to export their entire roadmap data as JSON files. This gives them complete ownership and portability of their data. The export function should be easily accessible, and users should be able to import previously exported files to restore or migrate their roadmaps. This also serves as a manual backup solution.

**Optional Cloud Sync**: For users who want to access their roadmaps across devices, implement an optional authentication and sync layer using a service like Supabase or Firebase. This remains frontend-focused because these services provide client-side SDKs that handle all the complexity. Users could choose to create an account and sync their data, but the app works perfectly without it. The sync strategy should be bidirectional, detecting conflicts and allowing users to choose which version to keep.

**Automatic Local Backups**: Implement periodic snapshots of the IndexedDB data stored in localStorage as compressed JSON. This provides redundancy in case IndexedDB corruption occurs, which is rare but possible.

## Technical Stack Recommendations

Your choice of Next.js is excellent for this application. I suggest using the App Router with React Server Components where appropriate, though most of your application will be client-side interactive components.

**Date Management**: Date-fns is perfect for this use case. You'll use it extensively for date calculations, formatting month headers, determining the current date's position, and calculating chronological ordering of objectives.

**State Management**: For an application of this complexity, I recommend Zustand for global state management. It's lightweight, has a simple API, and works beautifully with React hooks. You'll use it to manage the current roadmap, selected month, editing states, and filters.

**Styling**: Consider using Tailwind CSS for the elegant, modern design you envision. Its utility-first approach makes creating the responsive horizontal scroll layout straightforward. Pair it with Framer Motion for smooth animations when scrolling between months, highlighting current objectives, and transitioning between different states.

**Data Layer**: Dexie.js as mentioned earlier for IndexedDB management. It provides TypeScript support, which will make your data operations type-safe and maintainable.

**Additional Utilities**: React Hook Form for any forms where users create or edit objectives, Zod for runtime data validation to ensure data integrity, and React Beautiful DnD if you want to allow users to drag and drop objectives to reorder them manually.

## Enhanced Features & Interactions

Beyond the core functionality, consider these refinements that elevate the user experience without adding complexity:

**Smart Highlighting**: The current date indicator should be dynamic and subtle. Rather than just highlighting one objective, consider showing a visual marker that moves across the timeline, indicating "you are here." Objectives that are scheduled for today or this week could have special styling.

**Progress Visualization**: For month-long pinned objectives, show a progress bar or completion percentage that users can update. This provides satisfaction and motivation as they work through major goals.

**Energy Management Dashboard**: Since objectives have energy levels, create a view that shows the total energy commitment for each month. This helps users identify months where they might be overcommitted and need to rebalance their roadmap.

**Filtering and Views**: Allow users to filter objectives by tags, priority, or status. Provide alternative views like a list view for power users who want to see everything at once, or a compact view for long-term planning.

**Reflection Mode**: For past months, provide a reflection interface where users can add notes about what they learned, what went well, and what they'd change. This transforms the roadmap from just a planning tool into a personal growth journal.

**Templates**: Let users save objective patterns as templates. For example, if they have monthly recurring goals like "Read 2 books" or "Exercise 12 times," they can quickly populate new months with these templates.

## Implementation Phases

I suggest building this application in thoughtful phases. Start with the core month display and horizontal scrolling mechanism, ensuring the interface feels smooth and responsive. Then implement objective creation and basic CRUD operations with IndexedDB persistence.

Next, add the chronological ordering logic and current date highlighting, which is the application's signature feature. Follow this with the enhanced data properties like status tracking, tags, and priorities.

Finally, layer on the optional features like export/import, cloud sync, and advanced filtering. This phased approach keeps the application functional and usable at each stage while building toward the complete vision.
